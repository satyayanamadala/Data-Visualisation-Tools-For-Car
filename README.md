# Data-Visualisation-Tools-For-Car
This project is a Data-Visualisation-Tools-For-Car designed to manage and analyze the sales of cars through different dealers and companies. It simulates a real-world dealership network with customers, companies, dealers, and car transactions.

# Datasets Included
-Car.csv: Contains details of cars, including model, color, price, and associated company.

-Company.csv: Lists car manufacturing companies.

-Customer.csv: Contains customer information like name, phone, and address.

-Dealer.csv: Lists car dealers and their respective cities.

-Sales.csv: Records each car sale, linking cars, customers, dealers, and sale dates.

# Structure
This is a relational database model:

-Each car is linked to a company.

-Each sale links a car, customer, and dealer.

-All files are in CSV format and can be easily imported into any RDBMS (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).

#Possible Extensions
-Add dealer rating or customer feedback mechanisms.

-Build a dashboard using tools like Power BI, Tableau, or Python libraries (Plotly, Dash).

-Use SQL or Python (Pandas) for:

  -Sales trends analysis

  -Top-selling car models

  -Sales performance by dealer or city

#📌 Use Cases
-Educational projects for learning database design and analytics.

-Sample dataset for practicing SQL joins and aggregations.
