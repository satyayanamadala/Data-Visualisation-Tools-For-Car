# Data-Visualisation-Tools-For-Car

# Overview
This project involves analyzing car sales data to uncover valuable insights for the automotive industry. We utilized various datasets from multiple sources and performed comprehensive data visualization using Power BI to meet the project requirements.
This project is a Data-Visualisation-Tools-For-Car designed to manage and analyze the sales of cars through different dealers and companies. It simulates a real-world dealership network with customers, companies, dealers, and car transactions.

# Data Sources
1. CSV Files:
2. Excel Files:
3. SQL:
4. Access Database
5. Power BI Dataset:
# Visualization Tools
We used Power BI for data visualization due to its powerful capabilities in handling multiple data sources, interactive dashboard creation, and advanced graphical representation.

# Data Processing and Transformation
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handled missing values, data normalization, and standardization.
2. Data Integration: Merged data from various sources into a cohesive dataset.
3. Data Transformation: Applied necessary transformations such as pivoting, unpivoting, and type casting to ensure consistency.
4. Modeling and Relationships: Established relationships between different tables and datasets to enable comprehensive analysis.

# Datasets Included
-Car.csv: Contains details of cars, including model, color, price, and associated company.

-Company.csv: Lists car manufacturing companies.

-Customer.csv: Contains customer information like name, phone, and address.

-Dealer.csv: Lists car dealers and their respective cities.

-Sales.csv: Records each car sale, linking cars, customers, dealers, and sale dates.

# Structure
This is a relational database model:

-Each car is linked to a company.

-Each sale links a car, customer, and dealer.

-All files are in CSV format and can be easily imported into any RDBMS (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).

# Possible Extensions
-Add dealer rating or customer feedback mechanisms.

-Build a dashboard using tools like Power BI, Tableau, or Python libraries (Plotly, Dash).

-Use SQL or Python (Pandas) for:

  -Sales trends analysis

  -Top-selling car models

  -Sales performance by dealer or city

# Use Cases
-Educational projects for learning database design and analytics.

-Sample dataset for practicing SQL joins and aggregations.

-Prototype for building a dealership CRM system.
